# Encryptor

> Because one key is never enough.

A python-based software for encrypting and decrypting plain English text with two keys.

On the first run, the software will generate you **two keys**. These are used in order to encrypt and decrypt your messages.

* Automatically generates secure keys.
* Copies automatically the encrypted string to your clipboard after encrypting, for easy share with your friends!
* Keeps old keys under a folder `old_keys`
